# Stroke-Prediction-Analysis
The objective of this project is to utilize stroke data to create a predictive model for identifying  individuals who have a higher likelihood of experiencing a stroke. Our team will be analyzing the  correlation and impact between risk factors and the occurrence of strokes in individuals.

Question #2: Does a person’s residency type increase the risk of having a stroke? Are individuals that live in Urban settings more likely to have a stroke vs. those that live in a Rural setting?

My analysis of this dataset resulted in a null hypothesis for residency type affecting the likelihood of stroke, which directly contradicted my further research. I also analyzedthe percentages of each residency type and they were also very similar. The dataset documentation did not indicate when or where the sample was taken.

Overall I concluded the following:
•	There are striking and growing disparities in treatment for acute stroke in rural versus urban areas.  Although rural residents are more likely to have a usual source of health care (“a place to which they usually go when they are sick”), they are still less likely to have a local hospital and physician, more likely to be uninsured, and tend to report fewer annual health care visits. Such disparities may have an impact on stroke incidence in rural and urban areas given that the availability of health care resources has a strong influence on risk factor prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control. 
•	Stroke mortality is higher in rural compared with urban areas of the United States, and this seems to be because of higher stroke incidence rather than stroke case fatality. 
•	Embolic strokes are caused by a blood clot or plaque debris that develops elsewhere in the body and then travels to one of the blood vessels in the brain through the bloodstream and occur more frequently in urban populations
•	Thrombotic strokes are caused by a blood clot that develops in the blood vessels inside the brain   and are more prevalent in rural populations.
